A cube state is an element of (G := S_12 * S_8 * (Z/2Z)^12 * (Z/3Z)^8) (not necessarily with the group structure brought along).

i.e., a cube state is a permutation on the edges, a permutation on the corners, and some orientation data.

(*) Arbitrary (corner corner) (edge edge) can be realized as a conjugate of the T-perm, and
arbitrary (edge edge edge) can be realized as a conjugate of the U-perm.

Theorem:

If S is a cube state such that:

a. Edge orientation parity wrt the canonical orientation is 0 (even number of ones in the (Z/2Z)^12 component)
b. Corner orientation parity wrt the canonical orientation is 0 (0-mod-3 sum of the (Z/3Z)^8 component)
c. The piece position permutation has a decomposition t_1 ... t_n into transpositions, which is even (as an element of S_20)

then by (*)

there exists a sequence of quarter turns (also elems of G) equal to S.


implementation:

type in a string of piece positions

parse it into a cube state

make a three-cycle decomposer for S_12


a corner swap is

A' . T-perm . A

where

A = (RDR')^k . (some more Us or Ds) . (R'D'R)^k . (some Us or Ds)
