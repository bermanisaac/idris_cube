clockwise:
wbr in wbr -> rwb in wob 
wob in wob -> obw in ybo
ybo in ybo -> oyb in yrb
yrb in yrb -> rby in wbr

0 -> +1
0 -> -1
0 -> +1
0 -> -1

same for all non-(white or yellow) faces

white clockwise: all zeros, all good

all moves preserve corner parity

edge parity:

orient the cube white on top, yellow on top, or (rg) or (go) or (ob) or (br). read the stickers top/bottom. the parity contribution of the edge is the bit "has it been flipped from its canonical orientation".

canonical orientations:

corners:
1 wbr
2 wob
3 wgo
4 wrg
5 ygr
6 yog
7 ybo
8 yrb

edges:
1 wr
2 wg
3 wo
4 wb
5 yr
6 yg
7 yo
8 yb
9 rg
10 go
11 ob
12 br
